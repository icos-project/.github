# The ICOS Project

The primary objective of the ICOS project is to design, develop, and validate a meta operating system for the continuum, addressing key challenges such as:

- **Device volatility and heterogeneity**, virtualization across the continuum infrastructure, and diverse network connectivity;

- **Optimized, scalable service execution and performance**, including efficient resource utilization and reduced power consumption;

- **Ensuring trust, security, and privacy** across all layers of the system; and

- **Lowering integration costs** and effectively **mitigating** cloud provider lock-in, within a data-driven ecosystem grounded in the principles of openness, adaptability, data sharing, and aligned with a future edge market for services and data.

üß± **Structure of the ICOS Source Code**

This organization hosts all the open-source code developed by the ICOS project. The code is organized into multiple repositories, each corresponding to a different component of the ICOS system.

To begin exploring the ICOS code, we recommend starting with the following repositories:

- üìò [Documentation](https://github.com/icos-project/Documentation): Contains the source code for the ICOS [Techinical Documentation] provided in the [ICOS project website](https://www.icos-project.eu/docs/) 
- üíª [Shell](https://github.com/icos-project/Shell): A command-line tool that allows users to access and operate an ICOS system.
- üõ†Ô∏è [ICOS Controller Suite](https://github.com/icos-project/ICOS-Controller-Suite): This repository provides all the essential details for installing and deploying the ICOS Controller in a Kubernetes cluster.
- üì° [ICOS Agent Suite](https://github.com/icos-project/ICOS-Agent-Suite):This repository includes all required details for installing and deploying the ICOS Agent in a Kubernetes cluster.
- üß† [ICOS Meta OS](https://github.com/icos-project/ICOS-Meta-OS): This repository hosts the complete ICOS Meta OS codebase, structured by layers and modules, offering an easy way to explore the source code.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The repositories in this organization are mirrors of the original, private repositories used internally by the ICOS development team.
